  # In the past what we did was store the user.id in the session but the problem is that this is temporary 
  # and we want something more permanent (remember me). So we will use a permanent cookie. 
  # Another problem is we have user.id that we are storing in there and we donâ€™t want 
  # to store that in there because thats easily guessable and changeable by the user. 
  # Instead what we want is a unique token which is unguessable that we can store in a cookie.
