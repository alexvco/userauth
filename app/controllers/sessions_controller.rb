  # In the past what we did was store the user.id in the session but the problem is that this is temporary 
  # and we want something more permanent (remember me). So we will use a permanent cookie. 
  # Another problem is we have user.id that we are storing in there and we donâ€™t want 
  # to store that in there because thats easily guessable and changeable by the user. 
  # Instead what we want is a unique token which is unguessable that we can store in a cookie.
  # Cookies.permanent will make your cookie last between browser restarts for 20 years. Cookies by itself do no last between browser restarts, just like sessions.
  # The difference between a session and a cookie, is that the cookie is stored on the client side (browser), whereas the session is stored on the server side.
  # You may want/need to encrypt your cookie (using cookies.encrypted) for more secure application needs
  # http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionDispatch/Cookies.html for more info on cookies
